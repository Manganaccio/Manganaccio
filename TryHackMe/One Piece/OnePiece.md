  Welcome to Zou. It is an island located on the back of a massive, millennium-old elephant named Zunesha that roams the New World.
  Except this, there is not much to say about this island.

- # .secret_room.txt
  Inuarashi: You reached the center of the Whale, the majestic tree of Zou.
  Nekomamushi: We have hidden this place for centuries.
  Inuarashi: Indeed, it holds a secret.
  Nekomamushi: Do you see this red stele ? This is a Road Poneglyph.
  Luffy: A Road Poneglyph ??
  Inuarashi: There are four Road Poneglyphs around the world. Each of them gives one of the key to reach Laugh Tale and to find the One Piece.
  Luffy: The One Piece ?? That's my dream ! I will find it and I will become the Pirate King !!!
  Nekomamushi: A lot have tried but only one succeeded over the centuries, Gol D Roger, the former Pirate King.
  Inuarashi: It is commonly known that both Emperors, Big Mom and Kaido, own a Road Poneglyph but no one knows where is the last one.
  Nekomamushi: The other issue is the power of Big Mom and Kaido, they are Emperor due to their strength, you won't be able to take them down easily.
  Luffy: I will show them, there can be only one Pirate King and it will be me !!
  Inuarashi: There is another issue regarding the Road Poneglyph.
  Nekomamushi: They are written in an ancient language and a very few people around the world can actually read them.

  # What is the name of the tree that contains the 1st Road Poneglyph?
      the whale
